## FocusFlow | Enfoque
​A minimalist, bilingual productivity app designed to bridge the gap between daily tasks and long-term goals. Built with a "human-first" philosophy.
​🌟 The Philosophy
​Most planners treat every item the same. FocusFlow recognizes that your day is a mix of small chores and big milestones. It offers a clean, distraction-free environment to manage both, with the flexibility to move things to "tomorrow" when life gets in the way.
​## Key Features
​Dual-Track View: Separate columns for Daily Tasks and Big Goals.
​Localized Experience: Not just translated, but renamed. FocusFlow in English, Enfoque in Spanish.
​Smart Postpone: A one-click "Later" feature that mathematically advances the task date to the next day.
​PWA Ready: Install it directly on your mobile home screen or desktop via the browser. Works offline thanks to Service Worker caching.
​Contextual Actions: A clean "three-dot" menu for each task to keep the UI uncluttered.
## ​ Built With
​HTML5 & CSS3: Custom "Deep Space" dark theme with a focus on typography and scanability.
​Vanilla JavaScript: Lightweight logic handling date manipulation, state management, and the bilingual dictionary.
​Web Storage API: Uses localStorage to keep your data persistent without needing a backend database.
​Service Workers: Enables offline functionality and "Add to Home Screen" capabilities.
​ Installation
​Since this is a Progressive Web App (PWA), you don't need an app store:
​Visit the live URL on your mobile browser.
​Tap "Add to Home Screen" (Chrome) or "Share > Add to Home Screen" (Safari).
​Launch FocusFlow directly from your app drawer.
